# Earth616.ORG - Marvel MCU Timeline Widget

This is a widget for WordPress that utilizes the [Earth616.ORG MCU Timeline API.](https://mcu.earth616.org/display/TORNEVALL/Marvel+MCU+Timeline+API). Instead of having [a static information page like this](https://mcu.earth616.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=54132764), this WordPress widget makes it possible to have a live update view with information about Marvel movies and TV-shows, with dates when they are expected to premiere.

There is a complete example of what the live API is publishing at [SnapShot-616](https://snapshot.earth616.org/).

**Currently, there are two development repos:**

* [Github](https://github.com/Tornevall/wp-earth616org-mcuapi) -- For the community.
* [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.tornevall.net/projects/WWW/repos/wp-earth616org-mcuapi/browse) -- Where it all started.
